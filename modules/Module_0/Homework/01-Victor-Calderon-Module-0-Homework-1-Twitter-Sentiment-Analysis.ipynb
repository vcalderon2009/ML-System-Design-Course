    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Airline industry had a very hard time post-covid to sustain their business\n",
    "due to a long hault. It is very important for them to make sure they exceed\n",
    "customer expectations. The best way to evaluate performance is customer\n",
    "feedback. You are given a dataset of *airline tweets* from real customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sentiment analysis job about the problems of each major U.S. airline.\n",
    "Twitter data was scraped from *February of 2015* and contributors\n",
    "were asked to first classify *positive*, *negative*, and *neutral* tweents,\n",
    "followed by categorizing *negative reasons* (e.g. \"late flight\", or\n",
    "\"rude service\").\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use the text column and sentiment column to create a classification\n",
    "model that classifies a given tween into one of the 3 classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Positive\n",
    "- Negative\n",
    "- Neutral\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the dataset\n",

    "\n",
    "1. `airline_sentiment` : Defines the sentiment of the tweet\n",
    "2. `negative_reason` : Reason for the negative feedback (if negative).\n",
    "3. `Text` : Tweet text content\n",
    "4. `tweet_location` : Location, from which the tweet was posted.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps to perform\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load dataset: [link][datasetURL]\n",
    "2. Clean, preprocess data and EDA.\n",
    "3. Vectorise columns that contain text.\n",
    "4. Run classification model to classify - *positive*, *negative*, or *neutral*.\n",
    "5. Evaluate model.\n",
